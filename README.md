# kotscan


An Android app to scan QR codes using Kotlin programming language and the ZXing library, which is a popular library for QR code scanning

First, make sure you have Android Studio installed on your computer.

Create a new Android Studio project.

Add ZXing as a dependency in your build.gradle file

Create a layout file (activity_main.xml) for your main activity with a button and a TextView to display the scanned QR code

Create your MainActivity.kt file

Make sure you have the necessary permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml

Run your app on an Android device or emulator, and you should be able to scan QR codes by pressing the "Scan QR Code" button. 
The scanned result will be displayed in the TextView below the button .
